                    <b>Cycle Lane Defence: Know Your Rights</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maria had always enjoyed her daily commute, cycling through the city’s dedicated cycle lanes. But one morning, as she pedaled along her usual route, a car suddenly swerved into her lane, forcing her to brake hard to avoid a collision. It wasn’t the first time she had encountered such close calls, but today, something was different. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    She remembered reading about her rights as a cyclist and decided to take action. In many cities, cycle lanes are legally protected spaces, and vehicles must yield to cyclists. Maria had every right to ride safely and uninterrupted. Armed with knowledge, she reported the incident to local authorities, knowing that the driver had violated traffic laws.

                <p>
                    Thanks to her understanding of her rights, Maria felt empowered. The local council launched an investigation, and the driver was fined for blocking the cycle lane. Her story spread across social media, encouraging other cyclists to stand up for their safety.

                    Cyclists often face challenges on the road, but knowing your rights can make a real difference. Cycle lanes are not just lines on the pavement—they’re essential spaces for safety, and riders have every right to defend them. Maria’s story serves as a reminder: always know your rights and ride confidently.
